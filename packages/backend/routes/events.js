 * Valid query params:
 *  - type: to filter by a given type
 *  - time: to filter by a time range. Not implemented yet (TODO)
 *  - user: to filter by the user that caused the event. It's usually going to
 *    be the builder
 *  - challengeId: to filter by a given challenge
 *  - buildId: to filter by a given build
 *  - reviewAction: to filter by 'approve' or 'reject'. Only works when type is
 *    not present or includes challenge.review
 *  - reviewer: to filter by reviewer. Only works when type is
 *    not present or includes challenge.review
 *
 * All params accept a comma separated list of values, allowing to filter for
 * multiple values at once. They act as an OR.
 * Every query param condition must be met for an event to pass the filter. Each query param acts as an AND.
